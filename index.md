## CVPR Tutorial On Distributed Private Machine Learning for Computer Vision: Federated Learning, Split Learning and Beyond

<a href=""><img src="nopeekcvpr.github.io/title.png" align="left" height="325" width="600"> </a>

This tutorial presents different methods for protecting confidential data on clients
while still allowing servers to train models. In particular, we focus on distributed deep learning
approaches under the constraint that local data sources of clients (e.g. photos on phones or
medical images at hospitals) are not allowed to be shared with the server or amongst other
clients due to privacy, regulations or trust. We describe such methods that include federated
learning, split learning, homomorphic encryption, and differential privacy for securely learning
and inferring with neural networks. We also study their trade-offs with regards to computational
resources and communication efficiency in addition to sharing practical know-how of deploying
such systems. 
<br/><br/>
**Takeaways:** Attendees will get an overview of secure, private distributed deep learning for
images and videos. Hands on examples of different distributed deep learning techniques that
operate while protecting confidential patterns in data will be shared. Finally, several in depth
examples demonstrating how these techniques can be implemented across various
configurations in different application domains will be shared.
